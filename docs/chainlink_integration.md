# Chainlink Oracle Integration for mJ Token Verification

This document outlines a high-level approach for integrating a Chainlink oracle to verify the creation of mJ tokens based on real-time energy usage data.

## High-Level Architecture

The proposed system consists of the following components:

1. **Data Source:** A reliable source providing real-time energy usage data for each user.  This could be smart meters, a dedicated API, or another suitable source.  The data source must be accessible and provide verifiable data.

2. **Chainlink Node:** A Chainlink node configured to access the data source.  This node fetches energy usage data and submits it to the smart contract.  Security and authentication are critical for this node.

3. **Smart Contract (`token.sol`):** The `token.sol` contract will be modified to include a function that interacts with the Chainlink oracle. This function triggers the oracle to fetch and verify data before minting mJ tokens.

4. **Off-Chain Reporting:** The Chainlink node reports energy usage data to the smart contract using Chainlink's off-chain reporting mechanism.  This ensures data integrity and security.

5. **Security Considerations:** Robust security measures are essential to prevent data manipulation.  This includes secure authentication and authorization for accessing the data source and verifying data integrity.  The Chainlink node and smart contract must be carefully secured.


## Smart Contract Modifications (`Token.sol`)

The `Token.sol` contract will need a new function to request data from the Chainlink oracle and mint mJ tokens based on verified data.  This function will likely involve:

* **Requesting Data:**  Calling a Chainlink oracle function to request energy usage data for a specific user.
* **Verifying Data:**  Checking the response from the oracle to ensure data integrity and validity.
* **Minting Tokens:**  Minting mJ tokens if the data is verified.

**Example (Placeholder):**

```solidity
function mintMJFromOracle(address user, bytes32 requestId) public onlyOracle {
    // Placeholder - Replace with actual Chainlink interaction
    uint256 energyUsed = getEnergyUsedFromOracle(requestId); // Function to retrieve data from Chainlink
    mintMJ(user, energyUsed);
}
```

This requires further development to integrate with the Chainlink network and implement the actual data retrieval and verification logic.  The `onlyOracle` modifier would need to be implemented to restrict access to this function.


## Future Steps

* Implement the actual Chainlink integration.
* Define the `getEnergyUsedFromOracle` function to retrieve and verify data from the Chainlink oracle.
* Implement security measures to protect against data manipulation.
* Thoroughly test the integration to ensure its reliability and security.
